# A Personal Library Project

## What is this project?

This project is to create a personal library of things that people collect. Right now I am working on creating the ability to add comics and books. 

## Tech Stack

The tech stack for this project is a react frontend, nodejs/express backend, and postgresql for the database.

I want to implement a graphql database once I get a working MVP of this application working. 


## List of things people collect that would be cool to add

* Funk Pops
  * Need to find a database for all funko pops

* Gundam Models
  * Need to find a database that lists all gundam models

* Anime
  * Need to see if book/comic book databases have different mangas or if there's a separate database I need to be looking in

* Trading Cards
  * Magic The Gathering
    * Need an API
  * Baseball Cards
    * Need an API
  * Football Cards
    * Need an API
  * Basketball Cards
    * Need an API

## Some To-Dos after getting initial concept completed

* Create my own comic book database to possibly be able to serve more people
* Figure out data schemes for GraphQL on top of my own comic book database
* Create a better name for the project
* I would absolutely love to figure out how to get comic book valuations 
* Add testing, and add it to a github actions

## To Do List for new features (so I don't forget)

* Add a way to get comics by filters
  * Search for comic books by name
  * Search for comic books by character
  * Search for comic books by story arc
* Create a function that uploads the story arc and what comic book it's tied to
* Create a function that uploads the character and what comic book it's tied to
* Add testing to be able to test it all
* Figure out Row Level Security and how to add it to my applicaiton to make sure my database stays secure
* Add true logging with npm package called winston
